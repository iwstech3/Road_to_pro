# Exercise 1: Library Management System (Encapsulation)
# --------------------------------------------------
# Create a Book class that demonstrates proper encapsulation:
# - Private attributes should include: __title, __author, __isbn, __is_available, add your own properties that are not private
# - Public methods should include: checkout(), return_book(), get_book_info()
# - Use proper getters and setters
# - Validate ISBN (must be 13 digits)
# - Track if book is available for checkout

# Example usage:
#     book = Book("Python Programming", "John Smith", "9780123456789")
#     book.checkout()  # Should mark book as unavailable
#     book.get_book_info()  # Should return formatted book information
