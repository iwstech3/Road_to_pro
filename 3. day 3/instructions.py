# TODO 1: Write a function that takes a string and returns the character that appears the most.
# Explanation:
# - Iterate through the string and count occurrences of each character using a dictionary.
# - Find the character with the highest count and return it.
# Edge Cases:
# - If multiple characters have the highest count, return the first one found.
# - Handle cases where the string is empty (return None or an appropriate message).
# Example: "banana" -> 'a'
